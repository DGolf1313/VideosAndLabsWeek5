		 * Four Pillars of OOP
		 * 1.Abstraction
		 *   -Triangle example, general triangle has characteristics, but specific triangles have details
		 * 2.Encapsulation
		 *   -Driving a car, you don't need to know to tella car to fire a cylindar,  just how to shift gas brake
		 * 3.Inheritance
		 *   -Allow to inherit from parent classes
		 * 4.Polymorphism
		 *   -can take different forms
		 *   -Animals (method) communicate, but each differently
		 *   	-dog -> Bark; cat ->Meow; bear ->Growl
		 * 
		 * Class - is how we structure our code in OOP
		 * Class is like a blueprint, 
		 * Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint.
		 * An object is an instance of a class
